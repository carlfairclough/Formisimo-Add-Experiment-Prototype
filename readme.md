# Formisimo Add Experiment Prototype

## What is this?
This is essentially my personal documentation of an updated add-experiment process for Formisimo.com.

## How did this project start?
It began with extensive wireframing, then extensive UI mockups, showing as many routes & scenarios as possible. The prototype is to iron out particular issues and make sure that all potential journeys are good ones, rather than bad ones.

## How is it being built?
I'm writing HTML, SCSS (locally compiled to CSS) and jQuery (with tidbits of vanilla JS). I'm also using elements of Dan Eden's animate.css library to try and get the basic interactions fleshed out quickly.

## Timescale
This entire project has lasted 10 working days.

## What was the problem?
The existing/old add-experiment process is quite frankly awful and is/was resulting in the app hemmoraging users.
